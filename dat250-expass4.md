## Tasks
* Experiment 1:
    * Ran the collection in Postman with this as the body of the PUT request:
      {
        "red": 3,
        "green": 2 
      }
* Experiment 2:
    * Implemented the required methods in TodoController so that all tests passed.

## Technical Problems
* Gradle version in IntelliJ was default JDK 20 so I had to download and change to JDK 17.
* No pending issues.
