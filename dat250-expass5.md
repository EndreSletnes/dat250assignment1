# Report Expass 5

## Tasks
* Task 1
  Everything worked fine.
* Task 2
  Modified the files to work as in the tutorial and built the jar file with gradle. I could then run the jar with the command java -jar build/libs/expass5-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar

## Techical problems
* IntelliJ didn't recognize the gradle build because it was set to default version 21, so I had to change it to 17.
* In task 2 when using curl to access localhost:8080 I had to use http:// first.
