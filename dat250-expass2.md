# Project Report - DAT250: expass2
* Link to github repository: https://github.com/EndreSletnes/dat250-jpa-exp2

## Tasks
* The database is stored in the root folder named DB.mv.db. The database is a H2 database and is created each time the tests are run or the CreditCardsMain are run because the property hibernate.hbm2ddl.auto is      set to "create". 
* Hibernate: 
    create table Customer (
        id bigint generated by default as identity,
        name varchar(255),
        primary key (id)
    )

* I thought it would be created 5 tables since there is 5 objects created, but there is created 8 tables. It looks like the ADDRESS_CUSTOMER table and the CUSTOMER_ADDRESS is pretty much the same so I don't know     why both are created.


##Problems
* IntelliJ used the wrong version of the H2 driver so I had to manually download and change the driver to the version declared in pom.xml.
* I got this error when running the tests: Expected: is <[no.hvl.dat250.jpa.tutorial.creditcards.Customer@7a814310]> but: was <[no.hvl.dat250.jpa.tutorial.creditcards.Customer@7a814310]>.
  Found out that the tests were expecting a Set and not a Collection as was in the given code.
